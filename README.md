## Introduction

This project provides a more navicable queue view for users. While it could
have been developed inside of InvenioRDM, this approach was easier and more
flexible.

## Installation

This portal has only been tested with the CaltechAUTHORS repository and is
designed for use at Caltech. Please let us know if you're interested in using
it elsewhere and we can make it more flexible. For caltech users, you need to 
have a CaltechAUTHORS access token set in the CTATOK environment variable or as 
a GitHub repo secret.

## Usage

You can harvest and render the table by [golng
here](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/irdm-queue-portal/actions/workflows/render.yaml)
and clicking the "Run Workflow" button.

## Known issues and limitations

This tool is designed for use at Caltech and has some hardcoded URLs. Let us
know if you're interested in using it elsewhere.
